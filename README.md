## Feibot

A discord chat bot integrated with OpenAI.

Before you start you need [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app) and [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/).
All of the Privileged Gateway Intents also need to be enabled in you discord bot.

### Manual Installation
For manual installation you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16 or above and a MongoDB server,
the reason for MongoDB is just to store the conversation messages. Which will be used to generate conversation responses from OpenAI.
If you don't want to host MongoDB yourself you can try getting it from [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/) for free.
